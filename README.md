# PSYC-301-Syllabus-Spring-2022
This is a copy of the syllabus for PSYC 301, Spring 2022, at Texas A&amp;M University
The main reason it is now here is that this used to be hosted on GitHub Enterprise at Texas A&M. But since I no longer work there, I have no access to it. Some faculty may be interested in my syllabi, so I am storing some of them here, on my public GitHub.
